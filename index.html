					<h3>Customer reviews:</h3>
					<blockquote>
						<q>We've been working with David as a freelancer for 4 years. He started with the complete redesign of
							our brand and the website, and then continued to supply markups for our additional products,
							including Email Marketing templates, and two website redesigns (each consisting of 20+ pages).
							Total above 200 hours.

							During this period we worked with two designers and two systems (UXPin and Figma), David has
							constantly delivered solid markups, responsive and cross-browser.

							Some of the requirements were very challenging, David never afraid to accept the challenge and
							always comes up with a great solution.

							He is very thorough and details oriented, no tiny shadow or dot in the design are ever missed.

							No doubt, David will become a valuable asset for any company.</q>
